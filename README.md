## CrewMaster MVP Backend APIs

### About 
A small set of backend APIs for MVP of CrewMaster, a solution to book crew members to shifts within boundary conditions


### How to run
gradle build
java -jar build/libs/backend-challenge-0.0.1.jar

The application will run on http://localhost:8080/
This url will render the Swagger api docs and app where you can make api calls and test the application

The swagger docs also details all the api endpoints, structure and the data.

 

###  Further improvements that can be done
1. More Test coverage and writing Integration tests
2. Interfacing services instead of depending directly on the implementations
3. With a better domain understanding, the dependency between the sub-modules could be improved
4. Exceptions could be more definite and meaningful rather than generic
